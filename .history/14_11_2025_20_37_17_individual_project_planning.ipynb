    "### 1. Data Description \n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses two datasets from a Minecraft research server: `players.csv` and `sessions.csv`.  \n",
    "`players.csv` contains 196 unique players and 7 variables, with one row per player.  \n",
    "`sessions.csv` contains 1535 recorded play sessions and 5 variables, with one row per session.  \n",
    "The two datasets are linked through the anonymized identifier `hashedEmail`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) players.csv\n",
    "Variables include:\n",
    "- `experience`: self-reported experience level (e.g., Pro, Veteran).\n",
    "- `subscribe`: whether the player subscribed to the project newsletter.\n",
    "- `hashedEmail`: anonymous player ID.\n",
    "- `played_hours`: total hours played.\n",
    "- `name`: in-game name.\n",
    "- `gender`: self-reported gender.\n",
    "- `Age`: age in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative variables include `played_hours` and `Age`; the others are categorical.  \n",
    "The unit of observation is one player.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) sessions.csv\n",
    "Variables include:\n",
    "- `hashedEmail`: links session to a player.\n",
    "- `start_time` : Start session times.\n",
    "- `end_time`:  End session times.\n",
    "- `original_start_time` : numeric timestamps.\n",
    "- `original_end_time`: numeric timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player may appear in many rows, since each row represents one login session.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Potential issues\n",
    "- Possible missing values in `Age`, `gender`, or `played_hours`.\n",
    "- Time variables appear in mixed formats and require conversion.\n",
    "- `hashedEmail` is an identifier and should not be used as a predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Data collection\n",
    "Demographic information was provided by players when joining the study, while session times were automatically recorded by the server. Email addresses were hashed to protect privacy."
